    content: `I still remember in August we were working on my startup idea which is to build a business management app, as a team we were figuring out our UVP ( unique value proposition ). On the other end, my brother wanted to start a trading business of masks and medical equipment that was an actual need of the hour for people at that time. My brother found a buyer and he started looking out for a seller; he started looking in the local directories, and finally, he got a seller ( let’s name him Raju ) from Punjab after having a conversation for few days or a week. My brother felt that he was a trustworthy guy because he shared GST number, address, pictures. 

    Now my brother requests my dad and asks him for an investment of 15,000. My dad gives him because he wanted him to progress in the business. Indeed that’s not a huge amount, my brother wanted to start on a small note. 
    
    Raju sends his bank account number that had the company name and a tax invoice. My brother transfers the amount, from there on that seller has never responded. As I got to know about this issue I did some background research. research says that everything he shared is not of his. Even the WhatsApp display picture he has is not of his. 
    
    The Impact &
    Evolution
    As a startup team, we started researching this problem, these kinds of problems are known as the collusion of buyer and seller. This happens every day, in every country and every platform.
    
    The kind of impact it had on my dad and brother was huge, they didn’t even want to trust any online e-commerce store, local directory website, at sometimes my dad used to say even if this a well-known website, place an order if there is COD. 
    
    Recently as we were transferring a huge sum of amount to an unknown vendor whom we met on google. The amount of tension and panic my dad went through and the number of negative thoughts I had were immense until he delivered the goods.
    
    Now imagine what kind of impact this places on our ecosystem. we already have the problem of trust in our country, these incidents just complicate them, and imagine the kind of problems businesses will face to prove themselves trustworthy who want to go digital or do borderless transactions. 
    
    So my team started knowing more about the problem, we understood there is nothing that gives an identity for trustworthy businesses, for every good activity from a business they have to be rewarded with something. 
    
    Then we started learning who credit score / cibil score works to measure the good financial behavior of an individual.
    
    After a lot of thoughts and measuring the possible outcomes, we created the concept of the business score which we call B SCORE. 
    
    B SCORE derives the health, trustworthiness of a business. The par B score is 750. It takes an average business 30 to 45 days of continuous good behavior to get to a par score There are multiple parameters for a ‘healthy B score’.  
    
    Every time a business owner does a good activity on Big business applications like sending Invoices, paying salary to staff on time, customers having a good experience, paying GST, the standard rate of revenue, meeting their Goals which are set by themselves and etc. 
    
    For every good activity, there are certain points allocated. 
    
    B score can be used by any business irrespective of their sector, place, size. 
    
    B score is about to launch in few weeks !
    
    you can pre-register at Bigbusinessapp.com 
    
    HAPPY B SCORING`,
